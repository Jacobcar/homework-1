class=header was changed to a header tag 

 seo class was changed to h1 

simplified name of website(was in 3 parts, now one)

use the h2 tag instead of individual id tags in the css of the social/brand/ benefit areas as they can become a group.

give the website a professional title to give the client more confidence in the legitmacy of the operation.

minimize the amount of div tags into classes to clean up the html side. (example: aside,main, and section)

add flex tags & media query to make the website more media friendly.
